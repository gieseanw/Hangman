Hangman
=======

This is a hangman game made by me after two semesters of C++ in 2007. I think it's a good example of what a new programming student should be capable (and incapable) of doing by that point. No use of the STL is made; sorted/unsorted containers were built as parts of early programming assignments. The project was made in Visual Studio 2008 and then converted to Visual Studio 2012 on Windows 7.
